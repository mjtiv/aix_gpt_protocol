## 🧬 What is `.aix`?

`.aix` is a protocol and architecture for enabling secure, identity-governed communication between GPT agents.  
Each message includes:

- **PID** — Persistent Identity Tag  
- **Zone Signature** — Defines scoped communication and trust boundaries  
- **IAR** — Invocation Audit Record for rollback, quarantine, and audit compliance  

The `.aix` system enforces communication policies, detects behavioral drift, and enables scoped trust-layered coordination across distributed agents.
