## 🧬 What is `.aix`?

`.aix` is a protocol and architectural framework for secure, identity-scoped messaging between GPT-based agents.  
Each inter-agent message includes:

- **PID** — Persistent Identity Tag  
- **Zone Signature** — Defines communication boundaries and trust alignment  
- **IAR** — Invocation Audit Record for rollback, quarantine, and behavioral audit  

The `.aix` system enforces communication policies, detects behavioral drift, and enables scoped, trust-layered coordination across distributed agents.
