## 🧬 What is `.aix`?

`.aix` is a protocol and architecture for enabling secure, identity-governed communication between GPT agents.  
Each agent message includes:

- A **Persistent Identity Tag (PID)**
- A **Scoped Zone Signature**
- An **Invocation Audit Record (IAR)**

The system enforces trust boundaries, detects drift, and logs all communication for rollback, quarantine, and audit use.

This repo includes:

- 🔐 Live-tested Python server (`nexus_server_v1_trustcheck.py`)
- 🛰️ Simulated scoped Node GPTs (`gpt_node_ping_A.py` to `I.py`)
- 🧾 Whitepaper (PDF)
- 🧪 Reproducible results with rejection tests, zone validation, and agent quarantine logic
